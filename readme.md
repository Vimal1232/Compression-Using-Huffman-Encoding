# Compression in C++ Using Huffman Coding

This repository contains a C++ implementation of Huffman coding, a popular algorithm for lossless data compression. The code is designed to read Text Files, compress its contents using Huffman coding.

## Features

- **Compression**: Efficiently compress Text Files using Huffman coding.
- **Binary Representation**: Store compressed data in a binary format for efficiency.
- **Shannon entropy**: As Close a Shannon entropy Limit as possible for the compressed data.
- **Decompression**: Implement functionality to decompress Text Files back to their original form.
- **File Handling**:
  - Read input from a file.
  - Write compressed data to a binary file.
  - Read compressed data from a binary file and decompress it.

## Upcoming Features

- **Images Support**: Extend the algorithm to handle image files for compression.

## Results

- **Refer to the Test.cpp file for Data That Was Used**
- **Original File Size**: 51kb
- **Compressed File Size**: 28kb
- **Compressed By**: 45.1%
- **Shannon Entropy**: 4.318 bits per character
- **Average Bits Per Character**: 4.459 bits per character
- **Compression Efficiency**: 96.83%
