# Compression in C++ Using Huffman Coding

This repository contains a C++ implementation of Huffman coding, a popular algorithm for lossless data compression. The code is designed to read a text file, compress its contents using Huffman coding.

## Features

- **Compression**: Efficiently compress text files using Huffman coding.
- **Binary Representation**: Store compressed data in a binary format for efficiency.
- **Shannon entropy**: As Close a Shannon entropy as possible for the compressed data.

## Upcoming Features

- **Decompression**: Implement functionality to decompress files back to their original form.
- **File Handling**: Support for reading and writing files in a more robust manner.
- **Images Support**: Extend the algorithm to handle image files for compression.

## Example

String = "Once upon a time, in a small village nestled beside a sparkling river, lived a young woman named Anya. Anya was known for her gentle spirit and kind heart, always ready to lend a helping hand to those in need. One day, a traveling merchant arrived in the village, his cart laden with exotic goods."

Results:

The String Size in bytes 297
The Compressed Size in Bytes 157
The Compression Ratio 1.89172
Compressed By 47.138%
